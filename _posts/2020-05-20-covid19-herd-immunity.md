It has been two months since the world started to confine itself because of Covid-19. As far as I am concerned, I checked the news actively for one week or two, but I got quickly bored as soon as I understood this pandemic will not disappear as fast as it appeared and spread.

And this was okay for me. I was already working remotely for my US client and the only difference this new situation made for me was that I had to stay at home most of the time.

We are now two months in this new pandemic and I still ask myself this question: **While waiting for a vaccine, is "Herd Immunity" the best strategy to fight Covid-19 ?**

I will probably not find an answer (because I am very far from knowing everything about Covid-19 and medicine in general) but let's read up a little on this question.

Dr. Christopher Labos, who has an epidemiology degree, says:

> Herd immunity is the concept that when enough people get an infection and are now immune, you’ve essentially protected the rest of the population because there’s nowhere for the virus to spread.

This statement implies the following elements:

* A virus only survives by jumping from person to person
* When you get infected by the virus, after a while you gain immunity from the production of antibodies

We also have other information at hands:

* Covid-19 probably needs 60 to 70 percent of the population to be immuned in order to be able to control the pandemic.
* The real number of infected people is probably far from the ones that are announced. For example, in both Ontario and Quebec, the official numbers would need to be **multiplied 14 times to reach more realistic numbers**.
* As the time of writing, 80 102 people are officially infected by the virus in Canada, and the country has a population of roughly 37.6 million inhabitants. 
80 102 * 14 ~= 1.1 million real Covid-19 cases. This gives us a ratio of **almost 3% infected people**.

It looks like we are very far from achieving herd immunity rates in Canada. With a linear rise of the infection within the population, we would need 40 to 45 months to reach the required rate, and this would **only** help us to control the disease, not fully stop it.

Note that:

* I have not lowered the real immunity process which will probably be affected by the multiple mutations of Covid-19 and the fact that an asymptomatic person infected might produce less antibodies than someone who got hit hard by the disease.
* I am not taking into account the mortality rate. Even if it is low (lower than 1%), it would imply at least 200 thousand of deaths (only in Canada). This is simply unacceptable.

We are still at the very beginning of this pandemic and I find myself really confused with the policies applied everywhere in the world and their different results. As far as this small research goes, all I can conclude is that this herd immunity strategy is rather irrelevant. The recent lockdown restriction easing only inspire me concern and mistrust.

I know this is a really complex topic and it will probably be covered in other articles in the next months.
