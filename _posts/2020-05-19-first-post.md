Here I am, taking on the challenge I read on this [post](https://100daystooffload.com/) : #100DaysToOffload.

Basically, this challenge is about writing a hundred articles in a year. I know myself quite well, this will probably never happen. But, who knows.

So here I am, thinking about this almost blank page and how it will be filled in the next weeks. I guess I will start very soon with my trends of the moment : digital nomad lifestyle, video game streaming, Kubernetes certification...

Let's get to work.
