My name is Michael Bertoni, I am a French software engineer currently specialized in DevOps activities.

My brain goes from one obsession to the other, I hope this blog will follow the same process. So don't worry if you read an article about container orchestretion after an article that deals with the latest Twitch streamer I am following.
